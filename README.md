### Hi üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is Geethaa..!

### **From Equations to Algorithms: My Journey into Data Analytics**

*As an M.Sc. Mathematics graduate and former Mathematics Teacher, I bring a uniquely robust foundation in analytical thinking üß†, logical reasoning, and problem-solving üß© to the exciting world of Data Analytics. My years in education truly sharpened my ability to simplify complex information and spot key patterns ‚Äì skills that are now my superpowers in deciphering data! üöÄ*

*I'm genuinely passionate about transforming raw data into actionable intelligence that drives smart decisions and optimizes processes. Think of me as a data storyteller who loves to turn numbers into compelling narratives! üìàüìñ*

*My core technical toolkit is ready for action: Excel (my spreadsheet wizardry! ‚ú®), SQL (database whisperer! üó£Ô∏è), Python (my coding companion! üêç), and Power BI (where data truly comes to life! üåà). I've honed these skills through significant hands-on projects from my SkilloVilla Data Analytics course üéì and a practical Data Analyst Internship at Inlighn Tech üè¢.*

*I'm eager to connect, contribute my analytical acumen, and continue to grow within a dynamic, data-driven environment! Let's build something awesome together! üí°ü§ù*
